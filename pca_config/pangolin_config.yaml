## This is the config file that determnines what analyses will
## be run on which sample subset from which parent BCF


#### DEFINITIONS SECTIONS #####

# every BCF file used here must correspond to the same
# reference genome and thus to the same scaffold groups file.
# These are identified here:
fai_path: PCA/genome.fasta.fai   # this is just a file that needs to be there, but likely will not be used (make it an empty file if you want)
scaff_group_path: PCA/scaftable.tsv  # this is the scaffold groups file you have made



# this is the short name and the path to the BCF file that will be used
# the key here (testy) corresponds to wildcard {bcf_id}.  The sample subsets
# should, of course, correspond to a particular
# bcf file, so they go here.  If there are meta data files for association
# studies in ANGSD, these go here as the dotsample.
bcf:
  pangolin:
    path: "/home/zhimei@colostate.edu/projects/data_scrap_pangolin/pca/Pangolin.merged_gatk.srs_filt.bcf"   
    sample_subsets:
      all:
        path: PCA/Pangolin_samplelist.txt  # get these fron bcftools query -l 
 

# same thing here, we can define different sets of bcftools filters
# that we might want to use, and we give them nicknames. The 
# nicknames/keys here correspond to wildcard

#### SETTING SECTIONS #####

pcangsd:
  url: git@github.com:eriqande/pcangsd.git
  version: 705ca4c19630ed9c2dd254b0bfd528b8ee25d5c0





#### PARAMETERS SECTION
# Here we can give some short names for different sets of parameters
# that we will use later for particular ultimate targets

# these are all the standard parameters in the file paths
main_params:
  standard:
    bcf: pangolin
    filt: snps05
    thin_spec: "100_1"
    maf: 0.05


# Here we provide different sets of parameters for particular
# analyses.
params:
  pcangsd_plain:
    no_frills:


#### TARGETS SECTION

# here we have a shorthand for describing target outputs.
# Each output is defined by a triple: [A, B, C] that lives under
# a heading which says which kind of analysis is desired.
# where 
#   - A is a nickname from main_params
#   - B is a nickname for a subsample that is appropriate to the BCF in A
#   - C is a nickname for the parameters defined in params for the particular analysis
#
# The idea here is that each of these triples can be used to define a file name
# or possibly multiple filenames.

targets:
  pcangsd_plain: # this is here in case you just want to do a simple PCA
